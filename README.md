# Diabetes Classification using a MLP and an SVM

- Implemented several multi-layer perceptron models and an SVM for diabetes classification

- Used skorch along with grid search to tune MLP hyperparameters and scikit learn based grid search for SVM tuning

- Best performing MLP obtained validation accuracy of 0.84 and 0.87 accuracy on test set. Best performing SVM achieved accuracy of 0.77 on validation and 0.75 on test.

# Packages
- Python Version: 3.8.11
